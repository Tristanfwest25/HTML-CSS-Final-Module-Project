I created a website using figma as an outline. After creating the structure for the replica of the website on figma, I then rebranded the style into my own. I inserted previous jobs, photos of the places i worked along with photos of myself performing. I matched my color scheme with the color scheme of my previous places of employment. I was unable to find icons to replace the icons in the "worked with" section and in my social media links so I kept those as placeholders. I added media queries to make the page responsive as well as used them to add a hamburger menu for when the screen size is smaller than a desktop.
